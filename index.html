    <p>Hello there!

    <p>Talking about family, I love my father whom I address as pops. He's motivating, encouraging, and always goes in hand-in-hand with me. He has always loved to stay by my side when things go against me. He's not just my dad, he's a companion for life. He never minds me disturbing at 2 at night just to ask a question about academics.I'm a lover of nature. Rain, moon, clouds, gardens, greenery is all I'm the most attracted towards. I love to be around it. I'm a lover of peace, harmony, and prosperity around me.</p>
